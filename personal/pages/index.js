              I'm a full stack developer (React.js & Node.js) with a focus on
              creating (and occasionally designing) exceptional digital
              experiences that are fast, accessible, visually appealing, and
              responsive. Even though I have been creating web applications for
              over 7 years, I still love it as if it was something new.
